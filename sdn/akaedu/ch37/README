This is a small program that demonstrates basic communication using UDP sockets.
It's similar to the previous demo but here the server sends an acknowledegement message back to the sender.

Before compiling it, you may want to edit port.h and set a
(hopefully unique for your environment) default port number
(in the range 1024...65535).

Then run make to compile it. It should work fine on linux or OS X systems.
(on solaris systems, you may need to add /usr/ccs/bin to your PATH environment)

1. Start the server
In one window, run
	./udp-recv

The server runs forever, listening for UDP packets on a port defined in port.h.
Each time a message is received, it is printed and an acknowledgement message is
sent pack to the client.
Break out of the server via ^C (or whatever your interrupt character is).

2. Client
In another window, run the client:
	./udp-send

As it's written, the server's address is set to 127.0.0.1, a 
special address for the local host, so the client and server should be on
the same machine if you don't change the address.
